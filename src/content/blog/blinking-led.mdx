### My First Post

Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, I will talk about some interesting projects you can create using Arduino.

### Getting Started with Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

### Example Projects

### Project 1: Blinking LED
One of the simplest projects is blinking an LED. Here is a sample code:
```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}

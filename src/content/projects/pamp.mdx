## Technologies Used

JavaScript powers the dynamic aspects of the platform, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

React is utilized to build the user interface, ensuring a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is used for styling, enabling rapid UI development with utility-first CSS classes.

## Code Example

Hereâ€™s a snippet of a React component styled with Tailwind CSS, showcasing the simplicity and efficiency of the tech stack used:

```cpp
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-md">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to Pamp</h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">Your service appointment booking solution.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
